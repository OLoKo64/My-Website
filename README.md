# My-Website

Hi, this is my first creation with React in the web, when complete this will be online as my personal site.

I,ve been updating this on my free time and experimenting with features in the way, thats why theres a lot of non documented changes.

The live folder is the one i've been working, the other is just for experiments.


# To do

I will change the layout on the books section, making on par with the rest of the site, removing the table and making a customized table.

I want to implement some animations making the site more interactive and less flat.
